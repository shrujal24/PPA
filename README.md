background.js: Explanation: chrome.runtime.onMessage.addListener  An event listener for messages from other scripts in the extension. Useful for background communication between the popup script and the content script. request.action === "goToHomePage" Whether the action of the message is to open the Chrome home page. If it is, open a new browser tab with chrome.tabs.create. chrome.tabs.create({ url: "chrome://newtab" }): This is the API call that opens a new tab in Chrome and sets it to the "new tab" page. The background script ensures that some actions - such as opening the home page - are executed upon receiving messages from different parts of the extension.

content.js: This script injects a modal on the webpage for analyzing the privacy policy.

Detailed Explanation: sessionStorage: Check whether the modal has already appeared in this session and prevent further displays. overlay and modal are HTML elements dynamically created to show Privacy Analyzer UI. Some styles would keep the modal centered and polished-looking. createStarRating: A function creates the star icons to visually show up a rating for a given privacy policy. It applies a conditional logic to color the stars given a rating. analyzeButton: Clicked to extract the text of the webpage and send it to the backend, Flask, for analysis. fetch API: Used to send an HTTP POST request to the backend server running on localhost:8000; sends policy text and waits on a JSON response with the analysis. buttonContainer: Contains the navigation buttons, "Proceed to Website" and "Go to Chrome Home". The latter opens a new tab using the Chrome API. Purpose: This script injects a modal onto any webpage to analyze the privacy policy and display the results.

main.py: This contains the backend part of your privacy policy analyzer, which is implemented using the Flask web framework. It receives HTTP requests from the extension and does some analysis on the privacy policy by using a large language model (LLM).

Detailed Explanation: Setting Up Flask: Instantiate a web server using the Flask framework to listen for HTTP POST requests on /analyze. CORS: the CORS package allows the Chrome extension-a different origin-to talk to the server. extract_json_from_text: utility function that uses regular expressions to extract JSON-like data from text. analyze_with_ollama: This runs the analysis using the Ollama language model, using subprocess.run to run the LLM and capture the output. This function formats the output of the LLM into structured JSON. subprocess: Allows Python to execute shell commands. Here it executes the LLaMA LLM and passes the given text of the privacy policy to it. Error Handling: If the LLM errors out or does not return JSON, an error is logged and returned to the front end. Purpose: This module acts like a bridge between the extension and the language model. It analyzes the privacy policy and returns ratings.

manifest.json: This is the configuration and permission file for your Chrome extension.

Explanation in detail: manifest_version declares the version of the manifest format. Version 3 is the latest and introduces significant changes to permissions and background scripts. name, version, description: These are basic metadata about the extension. permissions: These declare what the extension can do. For example, activeTab: It provides active permission to the extension to act upon currently the active tab. webNavigation: Allows intercepting and modifying navigation events. scripting: Allows execution of scripts. tabs: To manage tabs. host_permissions: The permission states that the extension can run on all URLs. action: It's used to define the popup interface along with icons used in the extension. background: This defines background.js as a service worker for handling background tasks of the application. content_scripts: Specifies the scripts to be injected into web pages along with the conditions for their execution. icons: It specifies icons that will be used for the extension in different sizes. It contains basic information about the extension to Chrome, like permissions, declared content scripts, and background behavior. 

popup.html: This defines the HTML structure and style for the popup that opens when the user interacts with the extension icon.

Detailed Explanation: The HTML Structure This contains a title (h2), a content box div#content, an "Analyze" button, and a hidden button container with "Proceed to Page" and "Go to Chrome Home" buttons. CSS Styles: It defines the layout, color, shadow, and responsive behavior of elements. These styles further enhance the interface, neat, and polished. Script Link: Include the popup.js script that implements the interactivity for this popup. Purpose: This is a simplified user interface for the Chrome extension popup. The Chrome extension guides the user through the analysis of a privacy policy and continues with the results received from such an analysis.

popup.js: holds the logic and interactivity code of the extension's popup UI.

Detailed Explanation: The DOMContentLoaded Event: Ensuring that the script only runs once the DOM is fully loaded. Listening for Events: analyzeButton: Send a POST request to the backend with a sample text of a privacy policy. Server returns a structured analysis that gets formatted and displayed in the popup. proceedButton: The button which closes the popup when clicked. goHomeButton: Opens a new tab in Chrome with the homepage and closes the popup. fetch API: Used for making asynchronous requests to the Flask server, handling the response. Purpose: Deal with the user's interactions in the popup, make the privacy policy analysis using the backend, and display the results or error messages.
